# LAM PCBs

This contains various revisions of LAM PDB (power distribution board) PCBs.

`r1.3` is the suggested revision for older LAM hexarotors.

`r2.0` is the suggested revision for newer HAM-based designs, as it supports higher current capacity (at the cost of a different mechanical footprint from 1.X).
